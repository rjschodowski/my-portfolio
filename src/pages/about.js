                        The year 2003 marked the genesis of my tech journey, where at Spring Arbor University I quickly found dorm life consisting of 
                        floor mates reverse engineering computers, programming, and playing hours of Call of Duty. Although I would go on to working 15 
                        years as a bilingual social worker, my intrigue for tech had been unwittingly kindled. In late 2018 I embarked on my first 
                        coding lessons, and by 2020, I <Link to="/lansinghelp" className={link}>built my first progressive web app</Link>, a local 
                        community human services directory, which led me to pursue a new passion: creating innovative, user-friendly technology that 
                        improves people's lives.

                        In my current role, I work on a project team for an automotive product as an embedded software vehicle 
                        integrator and validation tester, focusing on software test design, automated scripting, and technical writing. Iâ€™m driven by 
                        the challenge of developing technically robust, user-centered software, and I enjoy learning and teaching new skills. In my free 
                        time, aside from making whimsical techno songs in Garage Band with my dog Scout and his silky vocals, I create progressive web 
                        apps using Affinity Designer, React, GraphQL, and Tailwind CSS, always with a focus on a thoughtful user experience and clean code.
